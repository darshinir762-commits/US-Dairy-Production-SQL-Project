The objective of this project is to practice and demonstrate

SQL skills such as filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries,

and handling missing data.

** Database & Tools Used**

\- Database: SQLite

\- SQL Client: DBeaver

\- Data Source: CSV files (US dairy production data)

**Tables Used**

\- milk_production

\- cheese_production

\- yogurt_production

\- honey_production

\- coffee_production

\- state_lookup

**Key SQL Concepts Demonstrated**

\- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY

\- Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG)

\- GROUP BY

\- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN

\- DISTINCT

\- Subqueries

\- NULL handling

** Project Structure**

\- data/ : CSV dataset files

\- queries/ : SQL query files

\- screenshots/ : Output screenshots of executed queries

**Sample Analysis Performed**

\- Total milk production in 2023

\- Average honey production by year

\- States missing milk production data in 2023

\- Top states by cheese production

\- States producing both milk and yogurt in 2023

\- Cheese production in April 2023 including missing states

**Conclusion**

This project helped strengthen practical SQL querying skills

and working with real-world datasets using SQLite.
